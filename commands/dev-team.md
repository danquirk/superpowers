Invoke the superpowers:virtual-dev-team skill and follow it exactly as presented to you.

This workflow orchestrates multiple parallel subagents through:
1. Research gathering (4 parallel researchers)
2. PRD development (iterative user collaboration)
3. Task decomposition (dependency-aware planning)
4. Parallel implementation (with test engineers)
5. Specialist code review (architect, security, performance)

The system maintains state for pause/resume capability and requires user approval at each major checkpoint.
